## Introduction

  This report covers the calendar year of 2019 from two different CTDs and takes wind and rain data.  From these data points we find the time windows of wind and rain and their overlapping days.  We also inspect the data to see if there is any correlation of wind or rain between the two CTDs.


## Wind Speed and Rain Rate for each CTD throughout the year:

## Days when it is windy, rainy, neither or both:

We can clearly see from these graphs that though it is mostly windy throughout the year, there is much less wind and rain in the summer months (particularly August). The stormy weather also seems to pick up in December and February.

## Cross-correlation of wind speed at both sites:

![Fig 7](https://github.com/TheAvidArtist/MeteorologyPackageProject/blob/master/whoopsy.png)

The highest correlation is .428 at a time lag of 0.

## Cross-correlation of rain rate at both sites:

![Fig 8](https://github.com/TheAvidArtist/MeteorologyPackageProject/blob/master/Image3.png)

The highest correlation is .428 at a time lag of 0.

They both have their highest correlation (which is the same) at a time lag of 0, which makes sense because when there is no time lag they should be correlate the most but it also means that this data is most likely very wrong because these numbers should not be exactly the same.  It would also be difficult to determine whether the lags were related unless there was a very clear pattern, because we only have rain rate and wind speed, not the direction of either.  It would be hard to tell if the wind was travelling from one of the CTDs to the other without knowing the direction it was moving, and the same thing goes for clouds expelling rain.  There could be wind at one area and then wind at another area without either of them being at all related to each other.

## Monthly average of the wind speed and rain rate for each site:

![Fig 9](https://github.com/TheAvidArtist/MeteorologyPackageProject/blob/master/Image5.png)

Both wind and rain follow a trend of high in the early winter months, a short dip and then raised again in spring, and then much lower in summer and spiking in the fall.

September had the highest rain rate with .127mm/hr

August had the lowest rain rate with .004mm/hr

January had the highest wind speed with 6.64m/s

August had the lowest wind speed with 3.643m/s


## Conclusion

We can clearly see from all the graphs that the wind and rain pick up in the winter months and die down in the summer months.  Though the cross correlation may not be accurate in this report, the other data looks reasonable and we should be able to conclude that they are correlated.  The rain and winds pick up and slow down during the same times of the year for both locations.
